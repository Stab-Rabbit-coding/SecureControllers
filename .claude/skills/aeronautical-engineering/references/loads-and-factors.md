## 1. Limit, ultimate, and the factor between them

Three distinct quantities, routinely confused:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Limit load** | The maximum load expected in service. Structure must carry it with no detrimental permanent deformation. |
| **Ultimate load** | Limit load × factor of safety. Structure must carry it without failure, though permanent deformation is acceptable. |
| **Factor of safety (FOS)** | The multiplier between them. |

$$P_{ult} = P_{limit} \times \mathrm{FOS}$$

The airframe factor of safety is **1.5**, and this is current regulatory text,
not folklore. 14 CFR **§23.2230** *Limit and ultimate loads* [REF-FAA-002] states
that the applicant must determine:

> "(a) The limit loads, which are equal to the structural design loads unless
> otherwise specified elsewhere in this part; and (b) The ultimate loads, which
> are equal to the limit loads multiplied by a **1.5 factor of safety** unless
> otherwise specified elsewhere in this part."

**§23.2235** *Structural strength* then requires the structure to support limit
loads without "interference with the safe operation of the airplane" or
"detrimental permanent deformation," and to support ultimate loads.

### What Part 23 does *not* give you

The 2017 restructure made Part 23 performance-based, and it did **not** carry the
old numeric manoeuvring load factors forward. **§23.2200(b)** requires only:

> "Design maneuvering load factors not less than those, which service history
> shows, may occur within the structural design envelope."

The values +3.8 and −1.52, widely quoted as "the Part 23 load factors," appear
**nowhere in the current rule** — a full-text search of the retrieved Part 23
returns zero occurrences of either number. They belong to the pre-2017 §23.337.
Citing them to current Part 23 is a fabrication. If you need numeric factors,
they come from the accepted consensus standard for the certification basis, or
from your own service-history justification under §23.2200(b).

**§23.2215** *Flight load conditions* likewise specifies the load *conditions* —
atmospheric gusts "based on measured gust statistics," symmetric and asymmetric
manoeuvres, and asymmetric thrust from a powerplant failure — without giving
gust velocities in the rule.

### Special factors of safety — the additive-manufacturing hook

**§23.2265** requires a *special* factor of safety beyond the basic 1.5 for any
part whose critical design value is uncertain, or that is:

> "(2) Subject to appreciable variability because of uncertainties in
> manufacturing processes or inspection methods."

**Printed polymer structure sits squarely in that clause.** Layer adhesion,
raster orientation, moisture, and machine-to-machine variation are exactly the
"appreciable variability" contemplated. §23.2265(c) requires the highest
pertinent special factor to multiply each limit and ultimate load. Related,
**§23.2260(b)** requires that a fabrication process needing close control be
performed under an approved process specification — which for FDM means the
print profile is part of the design record, not a shop-floor choice.

For spaceflight-derived practice, NASA-STD-5001 [REF-NASA-001] sets out a
structured factor framework distinguishing design, yield, and ultimate factors.
**Its scope is spaceflight hardware.** Applying it to an aircraft is an analogy,
and must be labelled as one every time it is used.

## 2. The V-n manoeuvre envelope

The V-n diagram bounds load factor $n$ against equivalent airspeed $V$. It is the
input to every structural load case; build it first.

Load factor is the ratio of lift to weight:

$$n = \frac{L}{W}$$

### Stall boundary

The aerodynamic limit — the aircraft cannot generate more lift than $C_{L,\max}$
allows:

$$n_{\max,aero}(V) = \frac{\tfrac{1}{2}\,\rho\,V^{2}\,S\,C_{L,\max}}{W}$$

where $\rho$ is air density, $S$ the reference wing area. This is a parabola in
$V$. Below the stall boundary the aircraft stalls before reaching the structural
limit; above it, structure governs.

### Corner speed

The manoeuvring speed $V_A$ is where the stall boundary meets the positive
structural limit $n_1$ — the lowest speed at which the limit load factor can be
reached, and therefore the highest speed at which full control deflection is
aerodynamically bounded:

$$V_A = V_S \sqrt{n_1}$$

with $V_S$ the 1-g stall speed. Both in knots.

### Envelope corners

Construct the closed envelope from:

* $V_S$ at $n = 1$
* the stall parabola out to $V_A$ at $n = n_1$
* the horizontal $n = n_1$ line out to $V_D$
* $V_D$ down to $n = 0$
* the negative-side limit $n_2$ back to the inverted stall boundary

$V_C$ (design cruise) and $V_D$ (design dive) must come from the governing
certification basis or be adopted explicitly per §4.

## 3. Gust loads

Gusts impose load factors independent of pilot input. The incremental load factor
from a sharp-edged gust of velocity $U_{de}$, with gust alleviation factor $K_g$:

$$\Delta n = \frac{K_g\,U_{de}\,V\,a\,\rho_0\,S}{2\,W}$$

where $a$ is the wing lift-curve slope $\mathrm{d}C_L/\mathrm{d}\alpha$ per radian
and $\rho_0$ sea-level density. Gust and manoeuvre envelopes are overlaid; the
governing case is whichever is outermost at each speed.

Design gust velocities $U_{de}$ and the formulation of $K_g$ are **not** in
current Part 23, which requires only that gusts be "based on measured gust
statistics" (§23.2215(a)) [REF-FAA-002]. Numeric values come from the accepted
consensus standard for the certification basis. Do not quote a gust velocity
without naming the document it came from.

## 4. Adopting criteria when none are imposed

An sUAS operated under Part 107 [REF-FAA-001] has **no imposed structural
certification basis** — Part 107 governs operations, not airworthiness. This is
the usual situation for a purpose-built unmanned airframe, and it is a trap: the
absence of an imposed criterion is not the absence of a criterion.

Adopt one deliberately and record it:

1. **State the mission envelope** — max airspeed, max manoeuvre load factor, gust
   environment, and the operating weight range.
2. **Adopt limit load factors** with a stated rationale. Deriving them from the
   mission ("the airframe shall sustain a 3.0 g pull-up at MTOW") is defensible;
   inheriting them silently from a certification basis that does not apply is not.
3. **Adopt an FOS** and justify it. Where the structure is polymer additive
   manufacture, the factor must account for anisotropy, layer adhesion, and
   process variability — these are not covered by metallic-structure practice.
4. **Write all of it into the project requirements document** before sizing
   anything, and cite it from the analysis.

## 5. Margin of safety reporting

$$\mathrm{MS} = \frac{\text{allowable}}{\text{applied} \times \mathrm{FOS}} - 1$$

A positive MS passes; MS = 0 is exactly critical. Report MS with:

* the **allowable** and its source (material spec, test, or cited data)
* the **applied** load and the load case it comes from
* the **FOS** applied
* the **failure mode** the margin is against

A margin quoted without its failure mode is meaningless — a part can have a large
tensile margin and fail in buckling at the same load.

## 6. Threaded joints

NASA-STD-5020 [REF-NASA-002] gives a defensible methodology for threaded
fastening systems: preload determination and uncertainty, separation margins,
and joint-slip margins. As with NASA-STD-5001, the scope is spaceflight hardware
and its use elsewhere is an analogy to be labelled.

Key discipline points regardless of source:

* Preload uncertainty is large for torque-controlled installation — carry it
  explicitly rather than assuming nominal preload.
* Check **separation** and **slip** as distinct failure modes from fastener
  tensile failure.
* Thread engagement length governs whether the failure is fastener tension or
  thread stripping; in polymer parts, assume thread stripping governs until shown
  otherwise.
