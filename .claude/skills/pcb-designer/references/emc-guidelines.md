# EMC & Signal Integrity Quick Guide

For embedded boards with ESP32, high-speed SPI, and radio.

## Return Paths

**The #1 EMC rule:** Every signal has a return current that follows the path
of least impedance — which at high frequencies is the path directly under the
signal trace.

| Stackup | Return path | Quality |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2-layer (no GND plane) | Returns wander, find path through GND pour | Poor |
| 4-layer (L2 = GND) | Returns directly under trace on L1 | Excellent |
| 4-layer (L4 = signal, L3 = GND) | Same, but coupling to L3 not L2 | Good |

**Consequence:** A slot or gap in the GND plane forces return currents to
detour → increased EMI and crosstalk. **Never cut the L2 GND plane** with
long traces. Use vias to drop signals to L4 if needed.

## Decoupling Capacitors

### Per IC

- 0.1µF (100nF) ceramic cap on **every** VDD pin
- Place **within 5mm** of the pin (closer = better)
- Connect cap GND to IC GND pin with short trace, then to GND plane with via

### Bulk

- 10µF–47µF on main 3.3V rail near regulator output
- 10µF on battery input near charger IC

### Layout

```

## SPI High-Speed (40 MHz)

### Series Termination

Place 22Ω resistors **at the source** (MCU side), as close to the GPIO pin
as possible. This dampens reflections on the rising/falling edges.

### Length Matching

Match MOSI and SCLK lengths within the same SPI bus to ±2mm.
MISO doesn't need matching (different driver).

### Spacing

- SPI traces: keep >3× trace width spacing from other signals
- Don't run SPI parallel to I2C or UART for >5mm
- Cross at right angles if unavoidable

### Via Count

- Max 1 via per signal on high-speed SPI buses
- Each via adds ~0.5nH inductance and impedance discontinuity

## I2C Crosstalk Prevention

- Route I2C away from SPI SCLK (at least 10× trace width)
- Don't run I2C parallel to PWM signals (LEDs, buzzer)
- I2C is slow (400kHz) but sensitive — pull-ups are weak (4.7kΩ), so noise couples easily

## USB Differential Pairs

- Route D+ and D- as a **differential pair** (equal length, constant spacing)
- Target 90Ω differential impedance
- Keep total length < 50mm from MCU to connector
- Place ESD diodes **at the connector**, not at the MCU
- Shunt ESD current to GND plane with short vias

## Antenna Zone (ESP32)

### Keep-out: 15mm × 15mm × ALL LAYERS

```

- No copper (not even GND plane) in this zone
- No components, no mounting holes, no battery, no metal
- Antenna faces OUTWARD from board edge

### If using IPEX (external antenna)

- 50Ω microstrip from module to IPEX connector
- Keep microstrip short (< 10mm)
- No components within 3mm of microstrip

## Ground Plane Stitching

```
Board edge stitching:
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  │ ← GND vias every 5mm
│                                  │
│                                  │
│ ●                              ● │ ← Corners get vias
│                                  │
│                                  │
│ ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Place GND stitching vias every 5–10mm along board edges
- More vias near RF sections
- Stitch between top and bottom GND pours, and to inner GND plane

## Quick EMI Smell Test

Before exporting Gerber, check:

- [ ] L2 GND plane has NO long slots or cuts
- [ ] Every VDD pin has a decoupling cap within 5mm
- [ ] SPI MOSI/SCLK have 22Ω series termination at MCU
- [ ] SPI traces don't run parallel to I2C for >5mm
- [ ] Antenna keep-out zone is clear on ALL layers (no GND plane)
- [ ] USB ESD protection is at the connector, short path to GND
- [ ] No floating copper islands (all pours connected to GND)
- [ ] No traces crossing split planes (with 4L, shouldn't happen)
